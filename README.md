To play chess, first uncomment the desired players (note that MinimaxAI, AlphaBetaAI, and IterativeDeepeningAI cannot be player1, since their evaluation functions are designed for black). Next, simply run `python3 gui_chess.py` in the terminal. If you wish to play as a HumanPlayer, enter moves on the command line.
